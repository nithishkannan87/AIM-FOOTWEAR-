AIM FOOTWEAR – E-Commerce Website MVP
(Walkaroo Products Only)
1. App Overview & Objectives
AIM FOOTWEAR is a demo e-commerce website designed to showcase how a real footwear
retailer can sell Walkaroo brand footwear online. The application focuses on realistic browsing,
clear product presentation, and a familiar shopping experience similar to Amazon or
Flipkart—without implementing checkout or payments.
2. Target Audience
Primary users are online footwear buyers familiar with Walkaroo as a brand. They value comfort,
affordability, and simple navigation.
3. Product Scope
In scope: Homepage, product browsing, product details, size selection, add to cart, and cart review.
Out of scope: login, payments, order placement, delivery tracking, and backend systems.
4. Product Catalog Strategy
Single-brand catalog featuring Walkaroo products only, across categories such as Casual, Formal,
Sandals/Slippers, and Daily Wear. The catalog should feel like a growing brand retailer with 20–40
products.
5. Core Features & Functionality
Homepage with banners and featured products, product listing grid, product detail pages with size
selection, and cart summary.
6. User Experience & Design
Design should be simple, trustworthy, desktop-first, and responsive. Focus on clarity and familiar
e-commerce patterns.
7. Feedback, States & Errors
Includes loading indicators, add-to-cart success messages, size selection prompts, retry messages
for failures, and empty cart states.
8. Data & Assumptions
Static or mocked Walkaroo product data is used. No backend or payment integration. Cart data is
stored temporarily.
9. Security & Trust Considerations
No user data collection, no payment handling, and clear communication that the site is a demo.
10. Potential Challenges & Mitigation
Brand confusion is avoided by clearly positioning AIM FOOTWEAR as the retailer and Walkaroo as
the product brand.
11. Future Expansion
Possible future enhancements include multi-brand support, payments, user accounts, search,
wishlist, and admin panels.
12. Summary
This MVP demonstrates a realistic and professional footwear e-commerce experience suitable for
client presentations
